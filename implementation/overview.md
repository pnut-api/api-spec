## API

#### Current Version: 0.6.0
#### API Root: `https://api.pnut.io/v0`

*Last Updated 2017-07-25*

Welcome to the documentation for the pnut.io API.

If this is your first time here, it is recommended that you become familiar with a few universal tools dictated here in the *Implementation* section, and then read through the areas of *Authentication* that you will want to use.

The *How To* section has some examples and explanation of more nuanced situations.

Note that user objects are included in JSON in the documentation frequently enough that they are simply included as `{...}`, except in the user sections specifically requesting user objects.
