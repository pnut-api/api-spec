# API

__Current Version: 1.1.0 [(Changes)](../changes)__

API Root: https://api.pnut.io/v1

*Last Updated 2021-07-30*

Welcome to the documentation for the Pnut API.

__[Become a Developer](https://pnut.io/dev)__

If this is your first time here, it is recommended that you become familiar with the *Implementation* section and read through *Authentication* to determine what scopes and strategy you will want to use.

The *How To* section has some examples and explanation of some common situations.


#### Interactive Examples

cURL examples can be edited on-page (they have the HTML5 `contenteditable` property). To call the API from the docs and see the cURL responses live, you must log in and authorize the API Documentation app linked to from the examples. The API Documentation app doesn't work with a few PUT, PATCH, and POST examples because of their complexity.


## External Resources

You are welcome to talk over the API in the Developer Channel. Questions, requests, floating ideas--any development-related conversation is encouraged!


##### [Libraries](libraries)

List of libraries and code to easily interact with the API from various languages.


##### [API Documentation](https://github.com/pnut-api/api-spec)

##### Backup API Root

There is a backup API Root at https://api.pnut-api-1.org/v1. The same subdomains and endpoints are available with this domain. DNS issues are known to occur (especially internationally), and if one does not work, the other may.
