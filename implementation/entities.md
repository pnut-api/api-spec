### Entities

Entities are parsed on creation and update of objects.

Lengths and positions are using multibyte (UTF-32) code points. Notably, NSString and Javascript will not easily map to the same indices.


#### Links

Field|Type|Description
-|-|-
`link`|string|The URL. If http/s was not specified, http will have been added.
`text`|string|The anchor text
`len`|integer|Length of the text
`pos`|integer|Position of text within the string
`title`|string|The retrieved title of `link` (optional)
`description`|string|The retrieved description of `link` (optional)

An attempt is made after creation of posts to retrieve a `title` and `description` from any parsed links.

Inline and markdown links are parsed by the API by default.
To not parse markdown links, set `entities.parse_markdown_links=0` in the POSTed JSON object.
To not parse inline links, set `entities.parse_links=0`.

##### Markdown Links [<i class="fas fa-paragraph"></i>](#markdown-links) {#markdown-links}

This is the format for creating a markdown link:
```
[anchor text](https://example.com "optional title")
```
The example would be turned into `text`:
```
anchor text [example.com]
```
and `html`:
```
<a href="https://example.com" title="optional title">anchor text</a> [example.com]
```

##### URI Templates [<i class="fas fa-paragraph"></i>](#uri-templates) {#uri-templates}

When creating a post or message, you can signal to the API to replace the literal text `{object_id}` in links with the newly created post or message's ID.

For example, a post with this text:
```
link to this very post: https://posts.pnut.io/{object_id}
```
will become:
```
link to this very post: https://posts.pnut.io/58399
```


#### Mentions

Field|Type|Description
-|-|-
`id`|string|User ID
`len`|integer|Length of the mention
`pos`|integer|Position of the mention within the string
`text`|string|Username without the "at" symbol (`@`)
`is_leading`|boolean|If the mention comes before anything else in the string.
`is_copy`|boolean|If the mention comes immediately after a Forward Slash (`/`), or another mention that does. If so, it will be subject to the user's Copy Mention notification preference.

##### Leading Mention Examples [<i class="fas fa-paragraph"></i>](#leading-mentions}) {#leading-mentions}

All of these are leading mentions:
```
@bazbt3 spam?
```
```
@akulbe @jws Interestingly, I have absolutely no idea where I uploaded that. ðŸ˜œ
```
```
>~-> @ugum1 yo!
```

##### Copy Mentions [<i class="fas fa-paragraph"></i>](#copy-mentions) {#copy-mentions}

A copy mention is a way of copying someone on a post without being as direct as a leading mention or even a regular mention. Usually a person will end their post with `/@user` to add it to their mentions, but without immediacy.

All the mentions in this example are copy mentions:

#### Tags

Field|Type|Description
-|-|-
`len`|integer|Length of the tag
`pos`|integer|Position of the tag within the string
`text`|string|The tag without the hash symbol (`#`)
