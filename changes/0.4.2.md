## [v0.4.2](https://pnut.io/docs/api/changes/0.4.2) {#0.4.2}

This is a minor update to pnut.io.

### Features

Submitting `entities.links` on posts, messages, and users works (it is incongruously entities.links on posts and messages, but content.entities.links on users)
Markers are always included on `GET /channels/{channel_id}/messages` and can be included on `GET /channels/{channel_id}` with `include_marker=1` in the query


### Changes

Deactivating accounts is more straight-forward and consistent


### Fixes

Unicode `pos` and `len` on entities was not handled properly
Tags inside markdown were parsed, breaking html/text
`GET /users?ids=` can now be @-usernames and user IDs
`is_nsfw` was not consistently handled (and sometimes ignored)
