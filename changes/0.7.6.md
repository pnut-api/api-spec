## [v0.7.6](https://pnut.io/docs/changes/0.7.6) {#0.7.6}

This is a bug fix update to pnut.io.

### Features

* Option to require OTP passwords for password flow authentications

### Changes

* One-Time Passwords now create a short random string for a name, instead of user input
* More clarity on profile update form
* MFA login now allows "Remember login" cookie but requires the TOTP code. A failed attempt or leaving the page will unset the "Remember login" cookie.
* Web Flows and Password Flow return much more specific feedback when something is not set properly

### Fixes

* Password form validation required a digit and uppercase, which is not supposed to be required anymore
* Failed MFA login would redirect to the normal login without client authorization details, if they had been set
