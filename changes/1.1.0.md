### Features

#### "Welcoming committee" option for email digests

In your [account notifications](https://pnut.io/account/notifications), you can now enable regular digest E-mails that include "New users and posts from infrequent users". There was already an option to receive similar posts from people you follow, but now you can receive notices for posts from people you don't follow.

#### User followers and following can be ordered by last_post_id, followed_at, id

Sorting following lists can help you find more relevant users more easily. Could be interesting to pull up folks you haven't heard from recently, or sort by when they joined the network, for example.

#### User search can filter by is_following, is_follower

Limiting searches to `is_following=0` will only show users you aren't already following, while `is_follower=1` would only show users that do follow you.

#### New "256" post explore stream

A Post explore stream has been added which only shows posts that are 256 characters long.
