## [v0.4.0](https://pnut.io/docs/changes/0.4.0) {#0.4.0}

This is a major update to pnut.io. The following is notable.

### Features

* `raw` data on posts, messages, users, and channels
* Stream markers can be updated to the latest ID on post or message creation
* Channel-specific sticky messages
* Channel thread endpoint


### Changes

* Revising posts saves the complete original post, where it used to only preserve the original `text` and `html`
* `X-API-Version` header changed to a major.minor.bugfix format, though in 0.x.x, all are minor or bugfix changes


### Fixes

* Avatars/covers not showing on pnut.io profiles
* `/users/me/channels/subscribed` was ordered by ID only, now by most recent message or most recent creation, with clarifying `pagination_id`
* Requesting a token did not return the list of scopes for it
* New user creation did not properly handle the created "follow" action
* Calls for user avatars/covers were not forwarding query parameters

*Released 2017-01-07*
