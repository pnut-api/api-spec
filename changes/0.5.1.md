## [v0.5.1](https://pnut.io/docs/api/changes/0.5.1) {#0.5.1}

This is a minor feature and bug fix update to pnut.io.

### Features

* The first developer to authorize an extended scope can now customize a description of what it is used for, when users authorize the scope in the future ("Content Types" in dev area)
* Users can change username once, and can change capitalization as often as they want, from pnut.io profile settings
* Including `#nsfw` in a post automatically marks it as "Not Safe for Work", unless explicitly marked otherwise
* Including `?exclude_channel_types=` on channel streams excludes the given types from the stream (opposite of `?channel_types=`)
* Including `?include_limited_users=1` on subscribed channel streams and individual channel calls will include users as limited objects in the ACL instead of user IDs only
* "Missed Conversations" explore stream added (random posts that had no interactions)

### Changes

* Activity log now includes administrative events (when an admin makes you a developer, suspends your account, etc.)
* Bare links are now parsed differently, and will accept more valid links, including IPv4/6 addresses

### Fixes

* Emoji tag streams did not function on pnut.io
* `/users/{user_id}/posts` now returns the user's posts even if an authorized user requests it after blocking or muting them
