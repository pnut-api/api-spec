## [v0.7.5](https://pnut.io/docs/api/changes/0.7.5) {#0.7.5}

### Features

* Pnut.io account area translations
* New Privacy page includes mutes, blocks, and new function to limit who can create new private message channels with you
* Bookmark E-mail notifications option for pnut badge supporters
* App Streams support `raw` by setting appropriate query parameters on the websocket link

### Changes

* Developer client "tokens" are no longer a thing; instead, new clients can be made by developers after a certain period
* `kind` is no longer required on file upload; you may juggle whether to specify `kind`, `mime_type`, neither, both
* `locale` limited to smaller list; more locales should be added on demand and as supportable
* `email` scope is not authorizable over Password Flow, to prevent possible privacy concern
* Link entity parsing adjusted (now includes links preceded by parenthesis)
* Message streams now allow negative `count` (`?count=-4`)
* App Streams now can differentiate between revised, reposted, and newly created or deleted posts

### Fixes

* Numerous possible edge cases with app streams returning partial objects
