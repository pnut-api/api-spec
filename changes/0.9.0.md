## [v0.9.0](https://pnut.io/docs/api/changes/0.9.0) {#0.9.0}

### Features

* User Streams (user-specific websockets, like App Streams for individual users)
* Invited users now have 512MiB of free storage, ensuring everyone has some free storage
* Users may gift Pnut Badges to other users
* Basic poll search
* Get multiple polls by ID in a single call
* Bookmarks may be saved with `note`, which is only visible to the user who bookmarked it, when retrieving their own bookmarks
* Clients can limit what scopes can be authorized
* `/sys/stats` now includes `counts.clients.public`, tracking clients that are "active/public" and usable by more than just a single user
* Alternative API domain https://pnut-api-1.org
* App Streams messages and posts now include `meta.suppress_notifications`, and `meta.subscribed_user_ids` to simplify notifications
* `include_replies` and `include_mention_posts` query parameters for post streams
* `has_mentions` post search filter

### Changes

* Requesting account deletion requires password verification
* Only human account-types can respond to polls
* `is_your_response` on poll options changed to `true` or `false` from `1` or `0`
* App Streams now have connection- and subscription-level query parameters
* App Streams objects are more consistent
* User tokens return with `storage.total` in addition to `storage.available`.

### Fixes

* Some old avatars were not deleted
* `/users/{id}/cover` was not redirecting properly
* "Account locked out" was logged after single failed login attempt
* `include_user=0` returned empty string instead of user's ID for embedded users on file objects
* Following a user in rapid succession could cause multiple listings of a user in your follows or followings
