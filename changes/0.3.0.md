## [v0.3.0](https://pnut.io/docs/api/changes/0.3.0) {#0.3.0}

This is a major update to pnut.io. The following is notable.

### Features

* More capable app directory
* Mutes and blocks management from pnut.io
* Channels
* Stream markers
* Client secret reset option


### Changes

* `pagination_id` added to user, post, message, and channel objects in paginated responses
* Following, followers, muted, and blocked user lists are now paginated
* PUT/DELETE bookmark returns the post bookmarked
* `presence` endpoints now include a timestamp of the last time a user was seen (even when their status is not "offline")
* Bookmarks are no longer restricted to the bookmarker
* `invited_by` no longer included on user objects (simply able to look it up on the invite tree on pnut.io)
* Developers required to enter password on every login
* Markdown links and normal links are parsed by default. To prevent parsing, must include `entities.parse_links=0`
* Requests for tokens respond with errors closer to OAuth 2.0 guidelines
* Removed `/posts/streams/feed`, `/posts/streams/link`, `/posts/streams/domain`, `/posts/streams/link` (more appropriate to retrieve via future search)
* Moved `/system/configuration` and `/system/statistics` to `/sys/config` and `/sys/stats`


### Fixes

* Inviting a user now creates a "follow" action when they auto-follow the inviter
* Blocks are missing fewer edge cases
* Revising a post parsing markdown links and normal links improperly
* Users' list of actions executed against them could only filter by one type; now any number
