## [v0.4.5](https://pnut.io/docs/changes/0.4.5) {#0.4.5}

This is a minor feature update to pnut.io.

### Features

* Invites are now created automatically
* Each app in the directory now has its own simple page, with expanded description
* Can hide posts directed at people you do not follow
* Can hide "copy mentions" on the mentions endpoint
* New Explore streams for posts that are Conversations, Trending, and Photos
* New endpoint `/users/me/channels/existing_pm` retrieves a channel between a given set of users, if it exists
* The subscribed channels endpoint (`/users/me/channels/subscribed`) includes count for unread PMs in the meta field
* Can now add "notes" to unused invites, to easily track what you're doing with them


### Changes

* PM notifications are strictly indicators that you have unread PMs, and no longer contain the text of the messages
* Better HTML version of the mention notification E-mail
* Underscores now allowed in tags
* Small improvement to threads and user profiles on pnut.io
* Clients now require approval before being published to the app directory


### Fixes

* Deauthorizing a client that doesn't have any tokens now deauthorizes its scopes properly
* Deleted posts should no longer show up in older threads/streams (as well as other bleeding possibilities)
* Channels were showing up multiple times (a subscription bug) on the subscribed channels endpoint
* `count=-**n**` now works as expected on post streams
* Text with E-mail addresses in it should not be parsed as links or mentions
