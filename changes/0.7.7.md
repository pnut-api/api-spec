### Features

* API Documentation app can be authorized, allowing you to make API calls from documentation and see the response live. The examples are editable on-page

### Changes

* Link parsing improvements
* Adjusted notification email timing
* Post and message URI Templates must use `{object_id}` instead of `{post_id}` in links
* Documentation includes type of access token required for endpoints (app vs user)

### Fixes

* Failed login went to MFA login
* `content.html` now begins with `<span itemscope itemtype="https://pnut.io/schemas/Post">` instead of `<span itemscope itemtype="https://pnut.io/schemas/Post">` to follow [microdata spec](http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#microdata_itemscope_itemtype)
