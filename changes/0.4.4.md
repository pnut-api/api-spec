## [v0.4.4](https://pnut.io/docs/changes/0.4.4) {#0.4.4}

This is a minor update to pnut.io.

### Features

* All non-developers now have the ability to create one client that only they can authorize
* Users who reposted or bookmarked posts can be included by including query parameters `include_reposted_by` and `include_bookmarked_by`
* Basic view of tags at `https://pnut.io/tags/tag` and RSS for them at `https://pnut.io/feed/rss/posts/tags/tag`


### Changes

* Non-markdown non-client-supplied links are restricted to known TLDs
* Mentions are allowed at the end of word breaks (think: `"@`, `'@`, `(@`)
* Improved pnut.io user profiles and threads


### Fixes

* Suspended and deleted accounts no longer retrievable from pnut.io
* `public_messages` and `messages` being authorized could result in only `public_messages` access
* User RSS handles reposts properly
